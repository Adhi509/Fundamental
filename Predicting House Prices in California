Title of Project: Predicting House Prices in California

Objective: To build a machine learning model that can predict house prices in California based on various features.

Data Source: The California Housing Prices dataset from the StatLib repository, which is based on the 1990 California census.

Import Library:

pandas for data manipulation
numpy for numerical operations
matplotlib and seaborn for data visualization
sklearn for machine learning modeling and evaluation
Import Data:

Load the California Housing Prices dataset using pandas.
Describe Data:

Explore the dataset to understand its structure, features, and data types.
Check for missing values and handle if necessary.
Statistical summary of the dataset.
Data Visualization:

Visualize the geographical distribution of housing prices.
Explore correlations between features and the target variable (house prices).
Plot histograms and box plots to understand the distribution of numerical variables.
Data Preprocessing:

Handle categorical variables using one-hot encoding or label encoding.
Scale numerical variables if necessary (e.g., using StandardScaler).
Define Target Variable (y) and Feature Variables (X):

Target Variable (y): Median house value (continuous numerical).
Feature Variables (X): Various features such as median income, housing occupancy, and geographical location.
Train Test Split:

Split the data into training and testing sets (e.g., 80% training, 20% testing).
Modeling:

Choose appropriate regression models (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor).
Train the models on the training data.
Model Evaluation:

Evaluate models using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared.
Compare performance across different models using cross-validation.
Prediction:

Make predictions on the test set using the trained model.
Explanation:

Interpret the model predictions and discuss the factors influencing house prices in California.
Provide insights based on feature importance and model coefficients.
This structured approach outlines the steps involved in building and evaluating a predictive model for house prices in California, covering data preparation, modeling, evaluation, and interpretation of results.
